    is a card game about two player summoning monsters and using them to attack the other player until their <strong> LP</strong> 
    or <strong>Life Point </strong> drops to 0. However, this is a basic explanation of the game. 
    For example, <strong> monsters </strong> come with effects, making even the weakest monster stat wise, a threat. 
    And there are cards like <strong> Spell </strong> and <strong>Trap</strong> cards which can either support or hinder your opponent. </p>
